# python-fundamental-assignment


In this assignment, I learned and practiced basic Python skills. I created different types of variables and did simple operations with them. I wrote a program to classify numbers as positive, negative, or zero, and I built a small calculator with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, making sure it handled errors like dividing by zero.

For the last task, I made a basic to-do list app. I organized the code into different files, with each file doing a specific job, which made the project easier to manage. I also learned how to use GitHub to upload my project and shared the link as required.
